# Crop Tools

This toolset provides a simple way to convert wide (landscape) video mp4 files into either portrait or square formats.

## How to Use

1. Drop your wide video files (all of the same filetype) into this folder.
2. Double-click either `wide-to-portrait` or `wide-to-square` to convert them to the desired format.
3. The converted files will be placed in the `output` folder.

## Tools

- `wide-to-portrait`: Converts a video to a portrait (9:16) video.
- `wide-to-square`: Converts a video to a square (1:1) video.

## Running Unsigned Scripts on MacOS

If you're running these tools on MacOS, you might encounter security settings that prevent you from running unsigned scripts. Here's how to allow the script to run:

1. After attempting to run the script, go to **System Preferences**.
2. Click on **Security & Privacy**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
4. In the lower half of the window, you should see a message like "'wide-to-portrait' was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer."
5. Click the button that says **Open Anyway** next to that message.
6. Confirm the action in the dialog that appears, and the script should run normally.

Note: The steps above will need to be repeated for each new script you want to run.

For more details about running unsigned scripts on MacOS, you can refer to Apple's official [support page](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).
